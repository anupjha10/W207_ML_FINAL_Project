## Project Title 
Facial Key Point Detection

## Description
* The objective of this project is to identify the location of facial keypoints on the images of face  
* There are 15 keypoints on the face such as :
- left_eye_center
- right_eye_cente
- left_eye_inner_corner
- left_eye_outer_corner
- right_eye_inner_corner
- right_eye_outer_corner
- left_eyebrow_inner_end
- left_eyebrow_outer_end_
- right_eyebrow_inner_end
- right_eyebrow_outer_end
- nose_tip
- mouth_left_corner
- mouth_right_corne
- mouth_center_top_lip
- mouth_center_bottom_lip
* Each of the feature has X and Y co-ordinates 
* The image itself is 96 X 96 grayscale image 
 
## Features Available 
* The value of 9216 pixels of the image are available for each training example 
* The values of pixels vary from 0 to 255 

## Feature Engineering 
We intend to do the following feature engineering to make the predictions accurate
 * 
    5. What type of feature engineering you can see fit in your model (top view)?
        - this can improve later when you start working and change features to improve performance (Ex: add features that are combinations of other features, etc.)
    6. What is the expected outcome of your project?
    7. Run preliminary likelihoods for data already present to include prior scores
    8. What classification algorithms would you use and why?
    9. Try using a baseline approach first and base your improvement on it (look into ZeroR rule)
    10. How many observations do you have and what do they look like (describe it)?
    11. What hyper parameters would you consider changing and what you achieve with each?
    12. Would you consider using dimension reduction and if so, why? What kind?
    13. Prepare 6-8 min presentation for each group
    14. Anything else that you think is important to put in writing and discuss
